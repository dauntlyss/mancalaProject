        <h1>History of Mancala</h1>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="history-col">
                <p>Mancala has simple rules, but it is far from easy to win. This paradoxical nature has kept it around for millennia. Mancala, which comes from the Arabic word “naqala” meaning “to move” has inspired an entire family of board games that represent sowing and harvesting. The game of mancala's exact origins are unknown, but the first boards date back some 3,600 years to the area of Africa that is current day Sudan. There is debate among anthropologists as to whether or not mancala was also used as a ritual or divination tool, since some ancient boards were found among temple ruins. Historians believe that mancala spread throughout Africa, then north into the Middle East and Asia, before eventually being brought to the United States via the trans-atlantic slave trade. There are still over 200 regional variations of mancala among the nations of Africa including Ayoayo, Bao, Oware, Awale, Ouril, Warri, and Endodoi to name a few. </p>
